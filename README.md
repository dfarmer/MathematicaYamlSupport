Mathematica YAML Support
==========================

This is just a quick wrapper around SnakeYaml to get YAML data into associations. I'm not quite happy with it as is, 
but figured I'd share it for anyone who could use it (maybe you can help!)

TODO
=======
* The JavaBlock stuff isn't quite right and it still seems to "leak" Java objects.
* Figure out how to make it easy to install (I'm confused on the jar file bit)
* Add export support (Honestly I'm not going to do this one, import was all I needed but if anyone else is interested it should be easy. PRs welcome.)

License
========= 
SnakeYaml is Apache 2.0, I like it as well so the Mathematica wrapper is also Apache 2.0 (see LICENSE).
